"""Bug Tickets MCP Server.

A minimal public, no-auth MCP server that serves an in-memory bug-ticket
dataset for the QuantumRoast coffee machine company. This replicates a
"public MCP endpoint" for the CUJ2 demo: the agent reaches it via the Agent
Gateway → SWP → Cloud NAT path, so the server's Cloud Run request logs show
the static NAT IP as the source address.

Serves three tools:
  list_tickets        — returns all tickets (with optional status/priority filter)
  get_ticket          — returns a single ticket by ID
  search_tickets      — full-text search across title + description

Transport: streamable-HTTP (Starlette), matching what MCPToolset +
StreamableHTTPConnectionParams expects. Mount point: /mcp
