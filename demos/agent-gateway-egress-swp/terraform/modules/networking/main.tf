/**
 * Networking Module
 *
 * Creates VPC network, primary subnet, Agent Gateway dedicated subnet,
 * Cloud Router, Cloud NAT with a reserved static IP, and a firewall rule
 * allowing PSC-I ingress to the agent-gateway subnet.
 *
 * The SWP proxy-only subnet is provisioned separately in modules/secure-web-proxy
 * so that module owns the full lifecycle of the SWP and its required subnet.
 * A VPC region can only have one active REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY subnet, so the
 * two subnets must not both use role = "ACTIVE" in the same region.
