/**
 * Secure Web Proxy (SWP) Module — Next-Hop Mode
 *
 * Deploys a Secure Web Proxy gateway in NEXT_HOP_ROUTING_MODE so that
 * Agent-Runtime egress (sourced from the Agent Gateway PSC-I subnet) is
 * steered through the proxy before exiting the VPC via Cloud NAT.
 *
 * Two policy-based routes implement the standard next-hop deployment pattern:
 *   1. Anti-loop route (higher priority): traffic sourced from the SWP's own
 *      proxy-only subnet exits via the default route, bypassing the proxy.
 *   2. Forced-next-hop route (lower priority): traffic sourced from the Agent
 *      Gateway subnet is redirected to the SWP gateway IP.
 *
 * TLS inspection is intentionally disabled (no certificate_urls set). The
 * gateway passes HTTP/HTTPS traffic through to Cloud NAT with the default
 * ALLOW policy rule — suitable for demonstration. See README extension points
 * for adding TLS inspection.
 *
 * Note: SWP auto-creates a hidden Cloud Router in the same region for its own
 * proxy egress. This is separate from the explicit Cloud Router created by the
 * networking module for Cloud NAT. Both coexist without conflict. Setting
 * delete_swg_autogen_router_on_destroy = true ensures the hidden router is
 * cleaned up when this gateway is destroyed.
 *
 * Reference: https://cloud.google.com/secure-web-proxy/docs/deploy-next-hop
 *
 * API format notes:
 *   - google_network_services_gateway requires network and subnetwork in the
 *     same URL format. We use self_link (full https://... URL) for both.
 *   - google_network_connectivity_policy_based_route requires network in the
 *     short "projects/P/global/networks/N" form, NOT the https:// URL.
 *     local.network_id strips the https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/ prefix
 *     from var.network_self_link to produce the required format.
